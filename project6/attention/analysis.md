# Analysis

## Layer 3, Head 9

In this attention head we can see the language model paying attention to the relationship between nouns and their pronouns. This can be seen in the first example where the noun "Henry", attends most to the pronoun "he". The same behavior can be seen for a more complex sentence, like the second example where there are multiple pronouns (her, she) referring to a noun (Rose) that is at the end of the sentence rather than the start of it.

Example Sentences:
- Henry is a [MASK] and he loves cars.
- A [MASK] fell on her head when she was born, so she was named Rose.

## Layer 1, Head 2

In this attention head we can see the language model paying attention to the relationship between verbs and their direct objects. This can be seen in the first example where the verb "attacked", attends most to the direct objecet "deer". The same behavior can be seen (not so clearly this time) in the second example.

Example Sentences:
- The [MASK] attacked the deer.
- The exhausted [MASK] suddenly attacked the unsuspecting deer
